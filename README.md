## Aim
The main aim is to implement Speaker Recognition system.Speaker recognition is the identification of a person from characteristics of voices (voice biometrics).It takes voice of 4 different speakers and tries to identify the speaker.The voices were recorded in both noisy and noise less environment.The results showed that the system works effectively in the noise less environment recognising all 4 voices corrently whereas in noisy environment 3 speakers were identified correctly.

## Requirements:
<ul>
  <li>
    Python 3.6 </li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Scipy</li>
  <li>Matplotlib</li>
  </ul>

## Steps to Implement the Program:
<ol>
  <li>
    Download all python files.</li>
<li>Download the train and test folder for non noisy folder and place both the folders in the same directory in which python files were downloaded. </li>
  <li>RUN test.py to carry out testing for noise less environment.</li>
  <li>Similarly now change the train and test folder with the noisy train and test folders. </li>
  <li>RUN test.py to carry out testing for noisy environment.</li>
  </ol>
  
## Note 
<ul>
<li>Ensure that test and train folder is in the same directory as test.py before running test.py</li>
<li>train.py is called in test.py. So you are required to run test.py only.(Ensure everything is in the same directory)</li>
